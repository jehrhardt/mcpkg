# Tasks: MCP Package Manager for AI Coding Agent Prompts and Resources

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mcpkg-is-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are written BEFORE implementation following TDD principles (per constitution requirement)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Source code: `mcpkg/` at repository root
- Tests: `mcpkg/tests/` (functional, integration, unit)
- Migrations: `mcpkg/migrations/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, no dependencies on US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires project context (US2 recommended but not blocking)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires project context (US2 recommended but not blocking)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Requires US3 and US4 to be useful (must have prompts/resources to serve)
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Requires US5 (MCP server must be running), US3, and US4 (prompts/resources must exist)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Models before services
- Services before CLI commands
- CLI commands before MCP handlers
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: T006-T009 (validation + models) can run in parallel; T010-T011 (storage tests + impl) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3-8**: All test tasks marked [P] within each story can run in parallel; all implementation tasks marked [P] within each story can run in parallel
- **Multiple Stories**: If team has capacity, US1, US2 can proceed in parallel after Foundational; US3, US4 can proceed in parallel; US6 can only start after US3, US4, US5

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Prompts)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 3 together:
Task: "Functional test for prompt add command in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_cli_prompt.py"
Task: "Functional test for prompt list command in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_cli_prompt.py"
Task: "Functional test for prompt update command in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_cli_prompt.py"
Task: "Functional test for prompt delete command in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_cli_prompt.py"
Task: "Functional test for MCP prompts/list in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_mcp_server.py"
Task: "Functional test for MCP prompts/get in mcpkg/tests/functional/test_mcp_server.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Workspace management)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Project management)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Prompts via CLI and MCP)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all three stories work together
7. Deploy/demo if ready

This MVP delivers:
- ‚úÖ Zero-config default workspace
- ‚úÖ Project organization
- ‚úÖ Prompt management via CLI
- ‚úÖ Prompt access via MCP for AI agents
- ‚úÖ Core value proposition validated

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can manage workspaces
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can manage projects
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can manage and access prompts (MVP!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can manage and access resources
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can scope MCP server to specific projects
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí AI agents can manage content dynamically
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 + User Story 2 (workspace and project management)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (prompts)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (resources)
3. After US3 + US4 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 5 (MCP server start)
   - Developer B: User Story 6 (MCP tools)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 96
**Task Count per User Story**:
- Setup: 5 tasks
- Foundational: 13 tasks
- US1 (Workspace management): 9 tasks
- US2 (Project management): 9 tasks
- US3 (Prompts CLI + MCP read): 13 tasks
- US4 (Resources CLI + MCP read): 13 tasks
- US5 (MCP server start): 10 tasks
- US6 (MCP tools for write access): 15 tasks
- Polish: 9 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 42 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (44% of tasks)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Can list/create/delete workspaces; default workspace auto-created
- US2: Can create/list/rename/delete projects independently
- US3: Can add prompts via CLI, retrieve via MCP protocol
- US4: Can add resources via CLI, retrieve via MCP protocol
- US5: Can start MCP server with specific project, only that project's content visible
- US6: Can use MCP tools to create/update/delete prompts and resources

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1-3 (Workspaces + Projects + Prompts) = 40 tasks total

**TDD Enforcement**: All test tasks MUST be completed and failing before implementation tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD cycle)
- Run CI checks after each phase (format, lint, typecheck, tests)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
